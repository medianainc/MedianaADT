# MedianaADT 
## Adaptive Design Toolkit: Adaptive designs commonly used in Phase III and seamless Phase II/III trials

The MedianaADT package provides efficient simulation-based tools for adaptive designs commonly used in Phase III and seamless Phase II/III trials. The Adaptive Design Toolkit currently includes the following five modules:

* Module A: Adaptive designs with data-driven sample size or event count re-estimation.
* Module B: Adaptive designs with data-driven treatment selection.
* Module C: Adaptive designs with data-driven population selection.
* Module D: Optimal selection of a futility stopping rule.
* Module E: Event prediction in event-driven trials.
